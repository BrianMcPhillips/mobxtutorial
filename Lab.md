Try it on your own! Use the source code to help you create a basic to do or list making app. 

1. Install your dependencies

2. Set up your stores. Do you want to use a class or a function? What values are you tracking? What do you want to do to your values? Add them to an array? Calculate how many of something you have? Start with one store and if you have time, add another one.

3. Set up your context provider and make sure your app has access to the store

4. Create a useStore hook to access your store in your components. 

5. Write your components. Make a list and an input. Access your store with your hooks and make it happen!
